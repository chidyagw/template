			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the research report is to analyze the importance of proteins in engineering and also discuss the type of writing that is involved in the engineering field in general. There are a lot of different ways different disciplines present information and use information. This project focuses on the type of communication that is involved in the field of engineering. It also focuses on the specific roles played by technology and research and their importance in the processing of information in the field. A student getting into this field has to be well acquainted with the different techniques of communication that are used in engineering that will be discussed in this paper. My research will focus on protein engineering and how it is been used in the making of medicines and also arguments on how some of the properties of the proteins are now been used to make weapons which is a detrimental to the society since it has become a security risk to the society. My project will focus on how information was gathered by the authors of the article and an analysis on how they used the different components of how information is gathered and processed in the discipline of engineering. </p>
