 +			<h1>Introduction</h1>
 +			<p>The field of protein engineering is a branch of the field of bio-medical engineering. This branch deals with the application of engineering principles to manipulate the biological systems for the good of the environment and in this case in the medical field. Bio-medical engineering is a growing field mainly because of the need for cures to the diseases that have ravaged our society for example cancer that we have no direct cure for. Proteins are not usually found in the desirable state that we want them to be and protein engineering serves as a path way for engineers to play around with technology to create models of proteins that can be used as we desire especially for the cure of diseases. Proteins function like a lock and key and this is the main property engineers use to make desirable proteins and enzyme complexes that can be used for medical purposes. The engineering field has its own type of communication. This usually involves technical communication since engineers have to be technically accurate all the time</p>
