			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>In the past Christianity has usually been associated with good things but during the start of the twentieth century it has become more of a business than a church as seen in the modern evangelical organizations. In the scriptures it is seen that those who heard the gospel and believed were brought in and welcomed into the church, not into a building or into a religion but to a group of people called the body of Christ. There were no church buildings back then and there were no divisions or denominations as they are known now. Today church is welcome for all the people. This should be the case because church is for all people but the only difference is that the church welcomes even those who say they do not believe in Christ so that they can have a share of their income. Church in the past used to be a place where people would be taught about how to avoid sin and also of the consequences of not following the example of Christ. This is contrary to the gospel been preached in the church today of how God is a source of financial gains. There is no talk about hell or heaven but money. Money has become the motivating force behind the churchâ€™s operation in this present day compared to the church in the past which was motivated by love, truth and a pure passion for God.  </p>
