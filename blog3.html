		<h1>my blog response</h1>
		<p> The lived on experiences project really helped me to refelect upon what i want to do in college. I also gained a lot of insight about the field i intend to go into and this was very important to me
		I also managed to talk to other people who have achieved a lot of great things in my field and get to talk to them about the 
		various things they have adone and some of the thinhs they have done diffrerntly in order for them to achieve their goals and dreams. The project was 
		very eye opening and helped me to realise the potential that i possess as a person and a student as well.</p>
