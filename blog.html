		<h1>my blog response</h1>
		<p>The video is about a guy who compares his life to the life of his uncle who was more like him. 
		the purpose of this video is to bring out to the world the life gay people are been exposed to in the various 
		communities they are in.In this particular instance the evangelical enviroment. The video also tries to bring out
		the notion that loving someone is not a sin despite the sexual orientation of the person and also that sex before 
		marriage with the person you love is not a sin.This I think is an attempt to nullify what the christian bible 
		says about love and sex.I also feel like it shows that the church is not doing enough to be there for the homosexuals.
		The video sends out a message that the church should not judge homosexuals but rather show them love and not push them 
		to the extend of committing suicide.</p>
		<p>The video achieves its purpose through a guy who lost his uncle and tells about the unfortunate experience his
		uncle had. The tone of the video is sad since the main actor in the video shows emotions of distress and immense
		sorrow as he describes how his uncle had noone to lean on and how he finds himself in asimmilar situation but trying
		to change his own destiny despite how simmilar he feels his uncle and him are.The way the video is done provokes 
		deep emotion and challenges the mind of the viewer to view gay people as people who can fall in love and justifies 
		why it is not a sin.
		</p>The video shows how the life of a man is influenced by his uncle.It starts by describing the life of the role 
		model and the circumstances sorrounding his life. After this it then decribes how these circumstances have affected
		the main actor's life . This will help me in my Lived Experinces project as I have learned that I should clearly describe
		the experiences that inspire me.
		
		<p> blog 2 : The lived experiences project helped me to think more about what I want to do as it was in the beginning of the semester. it also enabled me to think deep
			deeply about the major i had chosen and also get to network with people as I seeked information about my major and the area i want to work in and this was a lot of fun fun me
			I also managed to learn how to write and communicate effectively when explaining someting to someone who is not in my field and this has helped me to develop as a student.

		<p> blog 3: the south park cartoon was focused on people who are into palying games. this cartoon shows how 
		the gaming culture has destroyed the lifes of many people. As seen in the cartoon many people even the 
	        older ones got addicted to playing a game called mine league of legends. some of the characters in the movie also end up with 
	        their bodies wearing out and them becoming sick because they contionously played the game without doing anything else for example going to the toilet or even exercising their bodies.

                <p> blog 4: the eminem advertisement about deroit for me was a way for eminem to show how he is proud of where he grew up and 
                	also to help put the city of detroit on the map since it is looked down upon by a lot of people in the US.
                	The advert helped to showcase the city of detroit in awhole new light to the world which is exactly what a city that has been ravaged 
                	by economic crises needs in order to bring hope to the people and also to make people who might want 
                	to come and invest in detroit more hopeful of their chances.

                <p>  blog 5: the vidoe about the ancient Gods that we watched was enlightening . it showed how people believe 
                	that ancient medicine was used before. this evidence though should not by any means be used to nullify the existence of god
                	this is because the evidence is based on the paintings that were painted by people but this might have been merely 
                	imaginations by the artists of then of what they thought was God and this evidence is been used to serve atheists views that god does not exist and in my view this is biased .

                <p>  blog 6:  the cuktural analysis project that we did really helped me to understand the various cultures out there and also what really matters to the people in the world
                	i did a research on the evangelical society and how it is been manipulated by people to serve their selfish desires. this is the case 
                	in most african countries and even in the US as well. Investigating about this  really helped me to understand why certain individuals 
                	are manipulating the church to make money as I folled the life of a certain pastor called benny hinn and really got to understand what made him the way he is.It was really eye opening for me.

                <p>  blog 7: the formal research project was a good project as it helped me to understand how to research and communicate in my field. The project also helped me to understand how 
                	to use the library and also how to use scholarly and academic papers to analyse and write topics on my field. also important was learning
                	how people communicate and also the difference between scholarly and and trade articles and the relevance 
                	of their usage in the academic world.
                </p>
                
                <p> blog 8: the remix projecct was a reflection at past projects that had been done and it really helped me to analyse the 
                	work that I had done in the past. this was a fun project as it made me learn on how to do a documentary.
                	the project helped me to analyse a cultural topic on shopping addiction and also talk to some people 
                	who have been involved in this kind of situation and how they managed to deal with it. also making the documentary helped to understand ho documetaries are made in  general.
                </p>
                <p>  blog 9:  the final project is on the reflection and making a website for future students in what we learntn in the class
                	this is an excting project as it enables me to revise all the things I did through out the semester and
                	also share these experiences with some people who will take this class in the future and I find this to be very helpful part of this 
                	class.

                <p> BLOG 10: The video achieves its purpose through a guy who lost his uncle and tells about the unfortunate experience his
		uncle had. The tone of the video is sad since the main actor in the video shows emotions of distress and immense
		sorrow as he describes how his uncle had noone to lean on and how he finds himself in asimmilar situation but trying
		to change his own destiny despite how simmilar he feels his uncle and him are.The way the video is done provokes

		<p> BLOG 11:  The topic chosen was about shopping addiction. This topic was chosen after the group had analyzed the reason why a lot of people go bankrupt and end up stuck in a lot of debt. The composing of the issue helped me to better understand the reasons behind some people becoming shopping addicts that I might not have known if I had not done research on this issue.
The problem faced where getting to write the script for the documentary and been able to establish which parts where going to be the exciting parts of the documentary and also establishing who would act which part of the documentary. In general managing the sequence of how the documentary would be organized like. This was the most challenging part of the project for me. Also acting as the addict was also a challenge for me since it was my first performing in front of a camera for something as important as this documentary project
</p>
                 <p> blog 12:Research was mainly done over the internet. This involved looking at the statistics of how many people end up in debt every year because of excessive shopping. Also interviewing some people who talked about their reasons for shopping was a great source of information as this was first-hand information from the consumers themselves.
The interactions in the group were fruitful. This involved us creating a group mms where we would organize on where to meet and the time too. The only point of frustration for me was the point when we agreed to do interviews with people at a particular time and some of the group members showed up without doing theirs and we had to delay the making of the video and meet another day. In conclusion working as a group was effective since we eventually managed to finish the project in time and also got to know each other.
   </p>            <p>  blog 13: learning to use code academy was helpful as it helped me to learn how to code in html. This is what is used to create websites and it is very useful in the world 
   	today since programming is useful.Having the ability to create your own website is also very useful as it will enable me to be able to display my content when i nedd to showcase something 
   	
   </p>
   <p> blog 14: The video about the banning of gay marriages in the state of michigan that we watched is an example of how the 
   	tv adverts are used to manipulate the emotions of the people as they make their points known to the people using emotions
   	and also hiding important facts that might make the people not listen to them. this activity enabled me to think critically
   	and evaluate what i watch on the tv so that I do not fall victim to the manipulation that is done.
