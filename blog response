		<h1>my blog response</h1>
		<p>The video is about a guy who compares his life to the life of his uncle who was more like him. 
		the purpose of this video is to bring out to the world the life gay people are been exposed to in the various 
		communities they are in.In this particular instance the evangelical enviroment. The video also tries to bring out
		the notion that loving someone is not a sin despite the sexual orientation of the person and also that sex before 
		marriage with the person you love is not a sin.This I think is an attempt to nullify what the christian bible 
		says about love and sex.I also feel like it shows that the church is not doing enough to be there for the homosexuals.
		The video sends out a message that the church should not judge homosexuals but rather show them love and not push them 
		to the extend of committing suicide.</p>
		<p>The video achieves its purpose through a guy who lost his uncle and tells about the unfortunate experience his
		uncle had. The tone of the video is sad since the main actor in the video shows emotions of distress and immense
		sorrow as he describes how his uncle had noone to lean on and how he finds himself in asimmilar situation but trying
		to change his own destiny despite how simmilar he feels his uncle and him are.The way the video is done provokes 
		deep emotion and challenges the mind of the viewer to view gay people as people who can fall in love and justifies 
		why it is not a sin.
		</p>The video shows how the life of a man is influenced by his uncle.It starts by describing the life of the role 
		model and the circumstances sorrounding his life. After this it then decribes how these circumstances have affected
		the main actor's life . This will help me in my Lived Experinces project as I have learned that I should clearly describe
		the experiences that inspire me.
