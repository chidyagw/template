 +			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
 +			<p> Technology is also key in all the findings made by these articles. Most of the experiments in the field of engineering require high technology equipment in order for the necessary experiments to be carried out as in the example given in the second article of the observations made by the scientists of how certain drugs affect the blood capillary system. This requires a good amount of technology and this shows how the engineering field cannot advance without the use of high technology. In the study of proteins, protein models are made using advanced computer programming. This allows the scientists to study the behavior of proteins much easier which is something they would not be able to do if it wasnâ€™t for the role played by technology. I talked to Dr. Ron Averill who is a professor in the department of mechanical engineering.  He emphasized the role been played by technology and research in the field of engineering. He has been part of a group employed by Bill Gates to make containers to carry vaccines to remote places in Africa. The process involved researching about the places they were going to carry the vaccines. This included investigating about the maximum and minimum temperatures in the areas. Advanced technology was then used in the designing of the containers and this proved to me the importance of advanced technology in the engineering discipline and since engineers are the one responsible for the developing and designing of cutting edge technology it becomes so obvious that this field cannot survive without technology. </p>
