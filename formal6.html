			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p> In both these articles research is the key to all the findings made and all the arguments stated. This is characteristic of the engineering field. Hypothesizes are made and the research follows to test the theory that would have been put into place. For example scientists knew made theories about the way proteins work but they had to perform experiments to find out if their theories can really work in reality and as shown in the first article for the authors to find solutions to the problems caused by the use of protein engineering to create protein toxins they had to conduct a survey to see how many cases criminal activities involve people whose background criminal records have not been checked and after the findings they realized the importance of background check in people working in these fields. The second written by FDA law weekly also emphasizes the importance and use of research in the field of engineering in the paragraph that is second from the last one. The author talks about new research strategies that may be applied to develop new multifunctional proteins that work in other biomedical applications, from diagnostics and immunotherapy to tissue repair. This author shows that the future of gathering information and advancing in the field of engineering is strongly embedded in the use of research.
Technology is also key in all the findings made by these articles. Most of the experiments in the field of engineering require high technology equipment in order for the necessary experiments to be carried out as in the example given in the second article of the observations made by the scientists of how certain drugs affect the blood capillary system. This requires a good amount of technology and this shows how the engineering field cannot advance without the use of high technology. In the study of proteins, protein models are made using advanced computer programming. This allows the scientists to study the behavior of proteins much easier which is something they would not be able to do if it wasn’t for the role played by technology. I talked to Dr. Ron Averill who is a professor in the department of mechanical engineering.  He emphasized the role been played by technology and research in the field of engineering. He has been part of a group employed by Bill Gates to make containers to carry vaccines to remote places in Africa. The process involved researching about the places they were going to carry the vaccines. This included investigating about the maximum and minimum temperatures in the areas. Advanced technology was then used in the designing of the containers and this proved to me the importance of advanced technology in the engineering discipline and since engineers are the one responsible for the developing and designing of cutting edge technology it becomes so obvious that this field cannot survive without technology.
I have also talked to Charlene Chabata a student in Brown University who is currently involved in a research project in protein engineering. The purpose of the project she is working on is to make the e-coli bacteria in the stomach to release proteins that can be used to make medicine to cure people. According to her a lot of research has been done in this area. She also emphasizes the importance of deep research and the use of high advanced technology in the projects she is doing. They make use of technology like Mat lab to develop software prototypes of the kind of protein they want to come up with and also they make use of 3d printers to then bring the software model into reality. This also emphasizes the use of advanced technology in engineering. The use of exact and accurate calculations is also important which can be shown in the form of graphs. The two people I interviewed also stressed the importance of engineers’ ability to communicate their ideas in simple terms that the people not familiar with the field can be able to understand. The reason behind this is that most of the people the ideas are presented to may not be engineers or scientists and engineers have to communicate in a way that these people can also understand. This results in the publication of trade articles after a great discovery to enable the general public to understand. This as a result means engineers have to be affluent with both technical and non-technical forms of writing in order for them to make the greatest impact in their careers.
These two articles give out information that has very good implications to the world today. The first and most important impact to the world is in the way the articles enlighten the world on the advances been made in the engineering department. This helps answer questions of the people who may be curious about some things and articles as these ones serve a good purpose.  The article written by Jonathan .B and Tucker talks about measures that will be taken in order to mitigate the problems caused by the misuse of protein toxins. This contributes in assuring the people that scientists are making the world a better place and also most importantly safe to live in and also gives governments a chance to revise and strengthen their national security to mitigate the use of biological weapons. The two give the advantages and the disadvantages of protein engineering and also the solutions to the disadvantages caused by the manipulation of proteins to produce protein toxins.  The article by FDA law weekly talks about the advances been made in the engineering department in terms of research on cancer related issues and also future strategies that are been looked at. This information will enable investors to invest in the field and this will promote the growth of protein engineering and contribute to saving the lives of many people, animals and the environment at large.  However if this information about how proteins are used gets into the wrong hands it could be used by terrorists to use this knowledge to create biological weapons and this will impact the world negatively.
