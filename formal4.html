			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>The two articles this paper will analyze both support the use of proteins in the medical field. Tucker and Jonathan. B discuss the security risks posed by the advancement in protein engineering. This findings have shown that protein toxins are been acquired for use in assassination and other hostile affairs. This article also shows how potent this protein toxins are and how they can be able to kill a person at very low doses if administered to a person. This article shows how the advantage that the proteins have a legitimate use is been taken advantage by the wrong people and also poses a question to the public as to how this problem of misuse of protein toxins can be solved and also the authors also give their findings about how they believe this problem can be solved to reduce the security risk posed by the use of proteins as biological weapons. The author also explains the engineering technique of how the proteins are engineered to produce the deadly effect they have.
The trade article on protein engineering published by FDA law weekly shows how protein engineering is been used for the better of the world.  The purpose of this article is to also promote the good use of protein engineering. The article describes the way proteins function and how they work at cellular level. The article shows how protein engineering is been used for therapeutic benefits in the curing of cancer. This article serves as a report to the people on the advancement been made in protein engineering for the better of the health of the people.
The first article by Jonathan. B and Tucker have their argument centralized on the security risks of protein engineering. Mostly the question answered by their article is how protein engineering is a threat to the security of the world peace in general and also how the proteins are manipulated in a different way into weapons of assassination and warfare. These questions are answered are fully answered by these authors as they describe the use of the proteins as shown on page one of this article. The author talks about how living organisms produce protein toxins with varying levels of potency and how they can be easily administered to a victim through been inhaled, ingested or injected and can kill the victim in very low amounts and sometimes cannot be traced in the blood stream at times. The author also addresses the issue of the use of protein engineering in the making of weapons. The author uses the research he has made to answer the questions and also to fulfill the objective of his article. This method was very effective in the subject area since a lot of knowledge about protein engineering is required to address the subject matter. The author shows that he has done a lot of research in the area of protein engineering since he articulately describes the way the proteins function to bring the dangerous effects he is advocating against. The authors achieves this in page to of the article when they describe the protein engineering techniques used by the scientists to manipulate the properties of proteins for example” An alternative approach, which is known as ‘directed evolution’ or ‘molecular breeding’, involves generating random mutations in the gene encoding a protein, or shuffling the genes encoding different domains, to create hundreds or thousands of mutant proteins with slightly different structures. A high-throughput screening mechanism is then used to select those rare mutants that possess a desired property. Through repeated rounds of mutation and selection, it is possible to accelerate the evolution of ‘non-natural’ characteristics. An important advantage of molecular breeding is that it permits the directed engineering of a protein without knowing its precise structure or the effects of a given mutation. The main drawback of this approach is that it requires a large library of molecular variants and high-throughput selection techniques, which might not work for all proteins. Some researchers have successfully combined elements of rational design and directed evolution. This article agrees with other articles written in this field and it also acknowledges the fact that protein engineering is also been used for the good and this is shown on page one of this article. The last question answered by the authors is about the solutions to the problems caused by the use of these protein toxins and they answer this question excellently for example the licensing of the institutions that use this technology and also criminal background checks on people who use this type of technology in their day to day life be it in academia or in the medical field. 
The second article by FDA law weekly acts as an advocate or as an answer to the question most people ask about what is been done in the protein engineering sector. Governments spend a lot of money in investing in laboratories that carry out protein engineering. In most cases the money that is used is tax payer money so there is need for the people to see what is happening in this field. This will also act as the balance between the good and the bad consequences of the effects of protein engineering. The method used by this article is gathering information from the research facility and then presenting the findings to the people. The argument of the author in this article is centralized on the benefits of protein engineering and understanding the properties of proteins in general. I support and agree with the way the author supports his argument by way of using the information gathered from Stanford university research facility and also from other researchers to point out how proteins will be used in the advancement in the cure of cancer.
These two articles are giving two distinct arguments but all agree on the good use of the proteins in the health sector. The first article gives more detail about the subject matter including descriptions of the scientific processes involved in the manipulation of the proteins and the article is mainly intended for audience who are well knowledgeable about the subject matter. There is also use of diagrams to describe what will be going on and also exact figures and dates are mentioned and such is the characteristic of technical writing as technical writing involves been precise and also straight to the point. In both articles there is also use of scientific jargon. Even though the second article is intended for the general public the use of scientific jargon a lot in the article will make it harder for someone who is not familiar with the sciences to comprehend what is been talked about.
