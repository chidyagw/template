 +			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
 +			<p>In conclusion I agree with the arguments in both of these articles. The information was logical, clear and well ordered. The first article is written using clear and well-presented engineering jargon which is accurate for a scholarly article in the field of engineering. The article written by FDA weekly is a trade article that makes use of simple English that is also logically and clearly presented. The articles also provide a clear picture of the different kinds of communication that are involved in the engineering discipline. This is important as it provides a guideline for students entering the discipline on the different types of communication used. However the second article should have used more general language instead of scientific jargon for the most part to allow the general person to understand the message since it is a trade article and meant for the general public not only people with knowledge about the subject matter </p>
