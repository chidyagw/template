		<h1>lived experiences project title</h1>
		<p>I grew up in an environment where it was hard to come by basic needs like water and electricity. People had to find methods to survive in such harsh conditions. To do this they had to devise ways of getting what they did not have. With the few resources available people were able to provide the basic needs to their families. Growing up in this environment inspired the way I thought about the world and what I want to do with my life. I imagined what the disabled were going through in times like these and this made me feel obliged to do something to help the people. Having experienced this I had to think of a career that would enable to create great things even when I had few resources. Also as a good student in math and science I thought engineering would be a great choice for a career for me.</p>
		<p>I am considering studying in the college of engineering. Engineers basically make everything that is in the world whether they have enough resources or not. They make use of the principles of math and science to achieve this and over the years they have been very successful. There are various types of engineering which include chemical engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering among many other disciplines in this field.  I hope to study mechanical engineering and have a concentration in biomedical engineering. Mechanical biomedical engineers design and manufacture the necessary technology for doctors to use in saving lives. In my case I will use the knowledge I would have learnt in mechanical engineering to design equipment to help in the medical field.
When I was applying for university. I encountered a certain technology that influenced my choice of a career. It was a robotic arm I saw on the website of Rice university which had been designed and manufactured by their biomedical engineering students. They worked on this arm for 2 years in order to help a fellow student who could not use his arms and depended on his friends for help to perform basic functions. Through this they helped him become and independent person who no longer relied on people to perform basic functions. I imagined how much impact such technology would have on the people of my community. In addition to this piece of technology I was also fascinated by the use of light to transmit information.  A process whereby light sensors detect light and are able to transmit information as a result of the stimulus. This is the technology used in optic fibers. It is also the reason why we have high speed internet and can also make calls. Engineers are also on demand here in the US and all over the world. They are employed by the top companies in the world like google, Microsoft and apple. They also work in the big labs in the medical field developing new medicine and machinery to save the lives of people.
</p> <p> At one time the water problem in my community got much worse.   My father and I decided to dig a borehole. We were successful. The problem was that we had to carry the water from the borehole to the house and it was tiring. I remember how hard it was for the old woman next door who could not walk properly to carry the water and my siblings and I had to help her  to carry the water to her house. I imagined what the disabled in the community were going through in the face of such a crisis. My father and I tried to come up with a way to bring up the water to the house. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful because we did not have the necessary technology and also knowledge. Later on we invited a civil engineer to come and help us fix the problem and he managed to do the job in a very short space of time. When later on in my life I asked myself why the civil engineer had been successful and we had failed. I discovered that the only difference between us was he had the knowledge so I started my journey to cover the gap between myself and the engineer. This is the reason I am here at Michigan State University. </p>
<p>This event in my life showed me how fascinating science can be used to change the lives of other people even with meagre resources. I learned that science was actually practical. I was used to the theory my teachers would always teach me. At this point science became reality and I was very excited. This was the point I decided that I wanted to be an engineer. With all the knowledge I would gain I would be able to help the people of my community and make their lives better. I would be able to use the few resources my community can offer to save lives with the help of other engineers as well since engineering is all about team work. </p> <p>In conclusion, the environment I grew up in has had a great influence on the major and career path I ended up choosing. Living in an environment like this certainly made me learn to think like an engineer. This is because I had to improvise and make the best out of the few resources available. Also modern technology has played a great role. Seeing science theory been put into practice has been a dream come true since I came into the US. I have seen things I thought were never possible coming into reality before my very eyes.  </p>	</main>
