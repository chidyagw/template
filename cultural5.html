			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p> Since these big Christian organizations are not subject to any tax buy the government they should be taxed. Their financial activities should be audited just like other businesses are audited. Most of the Christian organizations claim to be using the money they get from people to help the poor and the needy in the society but a recent documentary by CBC news channel on hill song church in Australia shows that out of the millions of dollars they gain each year, only a 120 000 dollars was used to help the poor and for other philanthropic works and yet the other millions of dollars were not accounted for. The people donating to these organizations have a right to know what their money is been used for and this should be done. Healing miracles done by people like Benny Hinn should have documentation of the patientâ€™s medical records so that people know if the miracles are real or not. This is because these miracles have played a great part in gaining a multitude of people for these televangelist fraudsters. The pastors of these churches should also not be treated any differently and when they commit crime they should be arrested. The use of chemicals to make people dizzy and faint in churches should also be investigated. The link also between the Christian pastors and traditional or witch doctors must also be investigated as some sources suggest that these false prophets could be getting the powers to manipulate people from diabolic sources.</p>
