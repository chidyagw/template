			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The focus of the project is to analyze the current Christian church culture as compared to what it used to be in the past. The project will focus on recent evidence that has surfaced about the exposure of big names in the evangelical world and in this case Pastor Benny Hinn. It will also focus on the steps that have been taken to warn people about people like this. Benny Hinn is a televangelist best known for his miracles crusades regularly held in stadiums in big cities. Recent evidence from Christian watch dog, nbc, and nbc shows that Pastor Benny Hinn has built his ministry based on lies. The story of Benny Hinn illustrates how the Christian church culture has rapidly changed over the years. Most people now do not join the church because its reputation has been dragged into the mud by people like Pastor Benny whose teachings are based on their own quest to get rich and live luxurious lives at the expense of the ordinary Christian who is constantly looking for a better way to survive.
