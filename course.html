Course Retrospective Project
WRA 110 section 744
Professor Daniels</p>


<p>WRA 110 is a class that is focused on writing in the field of science and technology. The purpose of this project is to reflect on all the writing projects I did over the course of the semester in this class. The class had five major projects for the whole semester. This report will also serve to guide the new people who will get into this class on how to survive the class and at same time be able to enjoy it. The five projects done were Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project and the Course Retrospective Project.

The lived experiences project was about the analysis of a certain technology that has influenced the choice of my career choice. As an engineering student this project was really a lot of fun for me since I really got to connect all the pieces of technology that have influenced the reason I want to be an engineer. I ended up choosing a robotic arm I had seen on the Rice university website and described how seeing this type of technology had influenced my interests in bio medical engineering. This project enabled me to explore myself and since in this project our professor said she was not going to be strict on the style of writing we chose to use this enabled me to write freely making mistakes. When I got feedback on my assignment, I was then able to correct my mistakes and adapt to the ways I ought to write in college as compared to writing in high school. This was very helpful for me as a student.

The second project was the cultural analysis project which required the student to analyze a TV show, movie or a song. The analysis was required in order to be able to show the cultural issue been presented by that show and how it affects society. This project was very challenging for me since I do not watch a lot of TV and also do not listen to a lot of music so my topic was centralized on the evangelical culture with main focus on people like Benny Hinn. The only problem I faced was that I did not have enough evidence to support my claims so finding information was hard. This project was very helpful as it enabled me to analyze movies and music in a whole new different way. I would suggest for the student to pick a show that they really enjoy and understand in order for them to be able to analyze the issues. Picking something you enjoy will enable you to be able to watch it over and over again in order to pick the main issues been discussed in the music video or TV show. This was also the project we started to learn about how to write in MLA or APA format. I had never learnt to do this but during this project I managed to learn how to use these formats. 

The third project was the formal research project. This project was the introduction to how to research in any given field that one has chosen. This project had the most class activities. The most helpful class activity for this project was the library activity and the annotated bibliography activity. This two activities enabled me to learn to use the library resources such as journals. The annotated bibliography was also very helpful as it helped me to learn how to compile my sources and put them in an order such that I can be able to easily use them to write my paper. I picked my field of interest as the topic of research and I highly recommend anyone who will do this project in the future to pick their field of interest as the topic in this project. This is because a lot of time is required in this project. The time is mainly focused on learning how communication is done in your field of interest, the role of technology, research and the way people write in that field. Choosing a topic that does not interest you for this project might be disastrous and boring as you might end up changing the topic to something else and this might mean starting all over again. My topic was on bio medical engineering and the use of protein engineering in solving the issues that the health sector faces today. The requirement was to analyze one trade article and also one scholarly article. This enabled me to learn the difference between a trade article and a scholarly article which is something I did not know before this. I also got to research about my interests as I interviewed a professor who is in bio medical engineering. I also read a lot of papers on my field. This was a time I was having a hard time to decide the type of engineering I wanted to do. This project enabled me to know more and it influenced the decision I ended up making. I would strongly recommend anyone who will take this project to take it seriously because besides it been a writing class project it can also be life changing as well for a lot of people. 

The fourth project was the multimedia remix project.</p>  <p>This project required a person make a short documentary about a certain issue presented in the previous project. This was a revision of the projects we had done before. People were required to work in teams for this to be able to work. The documentary was supposed to be a four to six minute video. The team was supposed to point out the issues been faced and make an argument with supporting evidence too. This project was fun as my team and I decided to work on the issue of shopping addiction. This was really fun as we got to interview people about how they view the problem of shopping addiction and also talk to some people who have the problem. I also got a chance to act in the documentary. I had never been the guy who volunteers to be in front of the camera but on this project I got the chance to do this. I had to be confident and also try to be funny in the video for it to be fun. My advice for this project again is for the team to pick a topic they will enjoy doing. Time management is a big part of this project. I would advise doing things in good time so that you do not rush in the last days when approaching the deadline. At first it might seem as if there is not a lot to do on the project but as the deadline approaches the project seems like a ton of work and it might become unbearable. In conclusion surviving this project requires time management and also doing something you will enjoy and have fun.

The final project is the one right here. This project is not particularly hard. It requires one to analyze the all the things that were learnt in the semester and give a review of what was learned  and also be able to create a web version of this paper and put it on the website. This is probably the hardest part of the project and the class in general because making the template for the web version of the project requires coding in HMTL and this can be very challenging. This class also shows the importance of computer literacy in the education today. The knowledge required to complete the web version can be found on code academy were we learned the whole coding in HTML. The coding in HTML like any other programming requires a lot of effort for one to be able to make the web version of the paper. This final project is basically a test of all you did during the semester and that means if you did not learn anything you might have to learn all the material days before the deadline. My advice is to attend class and keep up with all that is happening as this can be a very rewarding class if all work is done.

Since this class was a hybrid class it also meant that a student has to manage time well in order to keep up with all that is happening and at the same time be proficient in writing. Sometimes the class required up to 3000 word papers. This can be challenging considering all the external pressures from the other classes, but the rewards are awesome as you learn to write well and the use of technology to improve your writing and this is very essential for a student to survive in college. I would recommend anyone looking for an introductory class in writing to start with this class. This class has a lot of fun activities and you stand to gain a lot.
