			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The church in the early days used to be about the salvation of people through Jesus the savior. All people needed to do was to repent and follow Christ and they would make their way to heaven. This is the concept theologians call discipleship. In recent times this has changed. It has led to the emergence of people like Benny Hinn. Benny Hinn preaches a prosperity gospel that brings out the message that if people come to God, God will give them something back in return. The true teaching about Christ says that people should come to God regardless of the benefits. The true teaching does not focus on financial gains as the benefit of following Christ but rather the fulfillment of been a disciple of Christ. Benny Hinnâ€™s ministry is the sort that preaches to people that they should give all they have to God for God to answer their prayers which is wrong according to the teachings of the bible. This has led to some poor desperate people to give all they have in the hope of getting a miracle since these men of God display great miracles on television. This miracles have been investigated by the Christian watchdog and channels like nbc to be fake since no medical records of the healing miracles have been documented. Pastor Benny Hinn is also reported to use church funds to live luxurious life and has refused to for auditors to dig in and find out how the church funds are used. Pastor Benny Hinn afford a luxurious life at the expense of desperate Christians who donate money to the church hoping to receive more from God which they usually never do. There are videos which show how Pastor Benny has been spending church funds. This ranges from owning a $10 million dollar house, a private jet that costs the church approximately $200,000 dollars per month and leaving in luxurious hotels with cost that average $3,000 dollars for one night. This shows how the church has changed from a place where people go to find hope to a business. Since these big church organizations are not taxed it means they make millions of free money. Some Christian organizations are believed to perform miracles of making money from nothing. This money is probably stolen and this ruins the economy and causes corruption. Recently in Zimbabwe a pastor of a big church was charged of sexually abusing some female church members after having deceived them that it was a way for them to receive favor from God and spiritual healing.
