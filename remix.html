Subject: Remix project assessment 

The topic chosen was about shopping addiction. This topic was chosen after the group had analyzed the reason why a lot of people go bankrupt and end up stuck in a lot of debt. The composing of the issue helped me to better understand the reasons behind some people becoming shopping addicts that I might not have known if I had not done research on this issue.
The problem faced where getting to write the script for the documentary and been able to establish which parts where going to be the exciting parts of the documentary and also establishing who would act which part of the documentary. In general managing the sequence of how the documentary would be organized like. This was the most challenging part of the project for me. Also acting as the addict was also a challenge for me since it was my first performing in front of a camera for something as important as this documentary project
Research was mainly done over the internet. This involved looking at the statistics of how many people end up in debt every year because of excessive shopping. Also interviewing some people who talked about their reasons for shopping was a great source of information as this was first-hand information from the consumers themselves.
The interactions in the group were fruitful. This involved us creating a group mms where we would organize on where to meet and the time too. The only point of frustration for me was the point when we agreed to do interviews with people at a particular time and some of the group members showed up without doing theirs and we had to delay the making of the video and meet another day. In conclusion working as a group was effective since we eventually managed to finish the project in time and also got to know each other.
