			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p> Since some of these big Christian organizations have been exposed, this has enlightened the people. The exposure of people like Benny Hinn will reduce skepticism about the Christian religion as a whole as those who still carry the voice of reason will doubt the genuinity of the religion as a whole. This is because they would have seen the exploitation of the church members in one faction. This is will reduce the number of people who are misled into believing that they are doing well. Since governments sometimes run out of money, it has been estimated that governments can make an estimated 4 billion dollars from taxing these big churches. Taxing of the Christian organizations will also give the governments a substantial amount of money to invest in the economy and in this way create employment for the unemployed and also to provide basic needs to the people especially in countries in Africa were the governments hardly survive financially. Auditing of the Christian organizations will push the Christian organizations to spend the money they receive from people to help the poor and the less privileged in the society. Since the exposure of Benny Hinn people who focused on investing their money in his ministry will be able to invest their money in other things that actually pay off. The ministry of Benny Hinn is one that spoiled the reputation of the church since other people outside the church saw the church as more of a business than a place of worship. This practice has spread all over the world in many countries. The exposure of people like Benny will alert those attending churches with similar doctrines to question themselves. This will also save the name of the true church which has been marred by the emergence of these false preachers. The exposure of Benny Hinn has also led to the beginning of a conversation in people with some people writing books in order to warn people about these black sheep in white clothing. Some people who were denied the chance to see Pastor Benny Hinn for healing have also found the opportunity to express their frustrations and views about him and this has helped a great deal in convincing people who are obsessed with Pastor Hinnâ€™s miracles that he is a fake. The exposure of these false teachers will also reduce the number of women and girls who are abused sexually in the name of spiritual healing. Documentation of medical records for the healing miracles will ensure that the miracles are real. The investigation of the use of chemicals in churches will ensure that people are not been manipulated or drugged in the church and avoid incidences such as the eating of grass by a congregation after a pastor had told them to do so. Some pastors use diabolic powers to manipulate the multitudes of people and investigating the link between the pastors and witch doctors will help people know the truth about the source of the power they believe in. </p>
